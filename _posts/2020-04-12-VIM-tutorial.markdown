REPLACE mode - overwrite text -> press r to enter

selection modes: VISUAL mode press v |  -line press Shift-V / -block press Ctrl-V

COMMAND LINE mode -> press :



to save and quit go to COMMAND MODE from NORMAL mode->   :wq

to quit  :quit or :q
to quit without saving :qa!

scroll using k and j for this config   and h l for left right
